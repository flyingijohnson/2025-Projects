Hey there! This repository will be used to interact with GitHub and be used as a folder for my projects this year.

For anyone else reading this, excuse my word vomit for now as I am just trying to document my progress and thoughts throughout the year
I intend to make this a more readable repository as a part of the process, but I am starting more as a personal journal than anything that
can be considered a public documentation.

My goals for this year:
  - Make a program that automatically searches through this repository and changes the PII or personal IPs.
  - Refresh my knowledge of Python, PowerShell, and Bash.
  - Get better aqquainted with SQL
  - Use SQL knowledge to create an alternative to an Access database that a business I have personal ties with uses.
  - Learn to automate things in Windows - specifically in Active Directory/related programs, while following best security practices.
  - Work on my home network:
      - Securing my digital assistant and connected devices.
      - Create a homelab for running VMs and other things.
      - Change security settings for all of my devices and keep a documented trail of changes.
To be continued
